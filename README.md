This project was scaffolded with Create-React-App,therefore, all other npm commands common to CRA works. i.e.

- `yarn start or npm run start` - Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

- `yarn test or npm run test` - Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

- `yarn build or npm run build` - Builds the app for production to the build folder. Will need a local server to run the app after build. Check `command line` instructions after running this command
